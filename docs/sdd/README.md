# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This folder stores artifacts generated by `codex-sdd`. It manages proposals, work, and approvals as files.

## Structure

- `specs/`: Current specs (deployed)
- `changes/`: Active proposals and work sessions
- `archive/`: Completed changes

## Approval Gate

- `codex-sdd approve` updates `90_decision.md` and `.codex/sdd/state.json`.
- `worktrees` / `test-plan` / `finalize` can run only for approved changes.

## Cache and Rerun

- `plans` records file and shard hashes, skipping re-runs for unchanged shards.
- Cache is stored in `.codex/sdd/state.json` and `.codex/sdd/runs/`.

## Notes

- Add `.codex/sdd/` to `.gitignore` (do not exclude `.codex/skills`).
- Generated artifacts are deterministically ordered (sorted).
